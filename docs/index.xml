      <description>Hi,
My name is Luan Guimarães, I was born in 1995 in Brasília, the capital of Brazil, in the middle of Cerrados, which is known as the Brazilian savannah, the second largest biome in Latin America. So it’s not impressive that I’m passionate about nature and outdoor sports, from rock climbing to surfing.
To top it off, I&amp;rsquo;m not that bass player, but I have some Brasília bars on the curriculum and three almost-there rock bands.</description>
