# L2N - My personal website

This repository is a simple github page that works as my personal web space, where I can post things related to me and what I do on the Internet.

### Build

To make changes I need to use the project [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). This page is based on the [VEC theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-vec/).

All I need to do is to change files under content, build the static assets, and publish it to the master branch. To build the changes, just run in the root directory:

```bash
hugo
```
