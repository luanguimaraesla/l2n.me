Hi,

My name is Luan Guimarães. I’m from Brazil and I currently live here, somewhere between the jungle and the beach, which probably explains my constant pull toward nature and movement. From rock climbing and mountain biking to sailing and, more recently, surfing.

Music has always been a big part of my life. I have a home studio, where I write and produce my own music, and these days I'm seriously studying electric guitar and music theory. Long before that, when I was just a young teenager, I played in rock bands and recorded whatever we could with what we had, one of those early experiments is [still around here 🎵](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQSlmyZ3zQ). Alongside music, I'm hopelessly addicted to reading philosophy and physics, usually jumping between technical material, old classics, and anything that helps me reason more clearly about reality.

I graduated in Software Engineering from the University of Brasília, where I was deeply shaped by free software and open-source culture. During that time, I was part of the university team that developed the [Brazilian Public Software Portal (SPB) 🔗](https://softwarepublico.gov.br), a federal initiative designed to promote, host, and reuse open-source software across public institutions. That experience cemented a lasting bias: software should be auditable, reusable, and collectively owned whenever possible.

Professionally, I work as a software architect and engineering leader, with extensive experience designing distributed, reliable, and high-performance systems. I’ve worked at Wildlife Studios, Sanar, and TimescaleDB, mostly around infrastructure, data platforms, and large-scale systems. My background as a Site Reliability Engineer was especially formative and deeply shaped how I think about building engineering teams, culture, processes, and systems that respond with reliability to real-world requirements.

In 2023, I co-founded [deX Labs 🚀](https://www.dexlabs.io/), where I served as CTO, leading the technical vision of a data engineering platform focused on ingestion, transformation, and orchestration at scale. At the end of 2025, deX was [aqui-hired by Nubank](https://international.nubank.com.br/company/nubank-strengthens-data-and-ai-strategy-with-dex-labs-team-hiring/), and the team joined to speed up development and give traction to Nubank's data and AI initiatives as part of its global technology organization.

I'm also a co-founder and CTO of [Sinkove 🏥](https://sinkove.com/), an AI-driven medical imaging company focused on improving healthcare workflows and outcomes through better data and models.

Outside of work, I enjoy documenting parts of my adventures, from sailing to outdoor explorations, which occasionally end up on [my YouTube channel 📹](https://www.youtube.com/@luanguimaraesla).

I believe in a free and fair world. I’m increasingly aware of the challenges posed by climate change, political instability, and the concentration of money and power, and I see free software, open knowledge, and transparent systems, including the responsible use of AI, as essential tools for navigating those tensions. Not as silver bullets, but as foundations that must be built, governed, and used with care. I’m here, learning as I go, trying to build things that make sense.

If any of this resonates, feel free to [send me a message 📧](mailto:luan@l2n.me).
