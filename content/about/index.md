Hi,

My name is Luan Guimarães, I was born in 1995 in Brasília, the capital of Brazil, in the middle of Cerrados, which is known as the Brazilian savannah, the second largest biome in Latin America. So it’s not impressive that I’m passionate about nature and outdoor sports, from rock climbing to surfing.

To top it off, I'm not that bass player, but I have some Brasília bars on the curriculum and three almost-there rock bands. [Give us a chance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQSlmyZ3zQ), I can prove it, the idea was nice!

For me, coding is an art. Like the painters, we follow some rules and we have our own patterns, but in the end, after pipeline succeeds, that thing is an interpretation of the world, full of expression and creativity. I graduated in Software Engineering by the University of Brasília, and now I'm setting the world on fire as a Data Engineer.

I believe in a free and just world. I see the preservation of humanity and rationality as the only categorical imperatives, and the democratization of free access to scientific knowledge being the only way to go! I'm here, learning to be human.

It would be nice to meet and learn with you, so feel free to [send me a message](mailto:luang@protonmail.ch).
